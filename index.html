      <div class="content">
        <h2>Singapore</h2>
        <p>The neighboring country of Malaysia! This place has unique malls and trendy stores that contains popular items. Singapore is by far the easiest country to explore due to its small size!</p>

        <h2>Thailand</h2>
        <p>One of the most unique country ever! The food pallet is very unique that you can't find tastes similar in any other countries. A very free culture and a prideful country.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <h2>Hong Kong</h2>
        <p>The 2nd most free place in China. Astonishing Buildings with colorful lights and vibes. One of the best places to shop for merchandises of anything like games and shows. Cousins to Taiwan!</p>

        <h2>Italy</h2>
        <p>My top 3 favourite country. Has a nostalgic old-styled buildings and interesting relics left behind thousands of years ago even going back to the Roman Empire. Not to mention, they have the best food on this list.</p>

        <h2>Vatican City</h2>
        <p>The most holy catholic country since it's all about catholicism. You could see beautiful historic arts and relics when the doors to them are open. Very gorgeous country and technically Italy!</p>
